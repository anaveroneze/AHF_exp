## How to run: 
$ bin/AHF-v1.0-091 AHF.input 

## Data to test:
#### 1. https://github.com/jngaravitoc/DwarfAssociations/tree/master/data/B64_WM5_10909_LG_7Mpc_2048 

## Info:
#### Header files:
Boxsize = 2.0 - for a non-cosmological simulation this should be the max(position)-min(position); Boxsize will be internally used as the length unit <br/>
TotalMass = 2 - this should be the sum of all your masses, i.e. the "TotalMass" <br/>
Omega0 = 0 <br/>
Lambda0 = 0 <br/>
for a non-cosmological simulation you should set Omega0=1 and Lambda0=0, but think carefully about your halos' edge definition (cf. RhoVir and Dvir in AHF.input); both Omega0 and Lambda0 are cosmological parameters... <br/>
PMass = 0 - PMass will internally be used as the mass unit <br/>
ACurrent = 0 - I would set ACurrent=1 <br/>

#### AHF.input:

To a N-body simulation with Gadget-2, with N=2*512^3 particles (DM+ gas) in a 200 Mpc/h box. <br/> 
LgridDomain 64 <br/>
LgridMax depends on the resolution of your simulation. but leaving it at 16777216 should be a good start<br/> 
NperDomCell 3 <br/>
NperRefCell 3 or 4 <br/>
VescTune - something between 1.1 and 1.5 (depends how conservative you are) <br/>
MaxGatherRad - 50% larger than the maximum radius expected in your simulation; 3 should be fine for a 200 Mpc/h box and <br/> LevelDomainDecomp. - 6, if you plan to analyse the simulation using the MPI version <br/>
